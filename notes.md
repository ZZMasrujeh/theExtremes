MEETINGS
Week 1 (17/10)
Attendance: Andreas, Konstantinos, Zacharias
This is the day the team was formed and the github repository was created, as part of the worksheet, in CO1111, for that day. We also identified each other’s strengths and weaknesses and divided the project into parts for everyone to work on. Finally, a general outline of what we wanted to achieve was discussed.

Week 2 ()
No meeting took place.

Week 3 (2/11)
Attendance: Andreas,  Zacharias (Konstantinos had a doctor’s appointment for his leg)
We further discussed about the outlined of the project, and we brainstormed some ideas on how to achieve it. At this time we have only implemented ‘/list ‘ and we will discuss more about how to present treasure hunts.

Week 4 (7/11)
Attendance: Andreas, Konstantinos, Zacharias
The meeting is done online, while all of simultaneously ran the web app with whatever had been done so far. We will focus on basic design ideas, and focus more on it as soon as some of the marketing part is ready, so we can follow its style.

Week 5 (15/11)
Attendance: Andreas, Konstantinos, Zacharias
This meeting is also done online. At this point we are discussing whether we should keep everything related to the web app in one page. We will try a bit of both having it in one page and having it in multiple pages and decide later on.

Week 6 (23/11)
Attendance: Andreas, Konstantinos, Zacharias
The app is progressing and we are considering various usability issues, such as how the app should respond if the users has finished a treasure hunt, how and at which point we should display a leaderboard, etc. Konstantinos has provided most of the content we had to create and will start focusing on social media. Andreas has progressed further with the design and Zacharias has finished implementing all API requests and will focus on some testing aspects.
